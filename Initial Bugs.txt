Bugs:
Search functionality is "limited"  a user must type in exact title  or "Title not found" 
User can not delete their movies from UI.  in Dev Tools, 401 error is displayed.
Delete route can not find ID
POSTs with malformed HTTP_Bodies can cause 500 Internal Server Errors.  
Creating a new or modifying a movie does not seem to work via the API...probably user error

Security:  
App pulls images directly from website that the user enters.  User could input malicious website.
User's token remains the same.  Should salt token creation with time.
